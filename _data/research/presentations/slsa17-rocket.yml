  Questions about the relationship between space in science and weird fiction and the radical construction of the future in contemporary theory.

  This paper contributes to the tensions between accelerationism and nihilism in contemporary theories of the future. I juxtapose theories of hope (represented by Alex Williams and Nick Srnicek's "#ACCELERATE Manifesto") and doom (represented by Eugene Thacker) as key examples of these two positions. Specifically, I explore space travel as a recurring motif in both bodies of work. Williams and Srnicek's version of accelerationism, which could be summarized as "Communism with rocket ships," connects the Marxist "way out is through" argument first identified by Benjamin Noys to contemporary science fiction tropes of space exploration, life extension, and mind expansion. In discussing this brand of accelerationism in conversation with Robert A. Heinlein, I show that Williams and Srnicek align with an older "rocket ship ideology" that saw space travel as atonement for Western humanism's colonialist sins. On the other hand, Thacker's brand of nihilism, informed by H.P. Lovecraft---who imagines Earth as an island from which humans should not stray---,is deeply suspicious of space beyond its dark, foreboding emptiness. To exemplify this view, I read Sam Kriss's "Manifesto of the Committee to Abolish Outer Space" as a rebuttal to rocket ship ideology. Kriss figures space travel as an escape from our Earthly responsibilities to deal with oppression. I conclude by juxtaposing Kriss's on rockets with Nick Land's optimistic take on accelerationist nihilism to ask if, in our contemporary moment, we must not only confront our muddied future but also our technological ideologies.
