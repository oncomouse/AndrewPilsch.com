  Infrastructure studies uncovers that a jungle is growing where Baudrillard says a desert should lie.

  This paper considers the rise of infrastructure studies—scholarship that traces the materiality sustaining modernity—as a rebuttal to Jean Baudrillard's claim in "Precision of the Simulacrum" that technology transforms the world into "the desert of the real." Focusing on infrastructure, challenges the argument that media technology evacuates the world of meaning and returns a simulated media object. As the frequency of accidents reveal the fragility of our modernity, scholars in the humanities are discovering that underneath Baudrillard's desert, a jungle has bloomed. In the tangle of cables, protocols, pipes, powerlines, and standards, we find amongst our insecure modernity a new real that sustains Baudrillard's simulation. Thus, I conclude that infrastructure studies engages our assumptions of media as disembodiment and our understanding of the postmodern and beyond.
