  This collection of Mina Loy's poems and manifestoes documents the canon of futurist works identified by Janet Lyon as crucial to understanding Loy's complicated relationship with avant-garde modernism. Additionally, Loy's usage of typography contains clues to how to interpret the poems, but many of these innovative, concrete features are lost when the poems are translated online. This online edition rectifies this lack by using CSS 3, HTML 5, and advanced web fonts to format Loy's poems in as close a format to their original publication as possible.

  Edition currently includes:

  * "Aphorisms on Futurism" (1914)
  * "Feminist Manifesto" (1914)
  * "Parturition" (1914)
  * _Songs to Joannes_ (1917)
