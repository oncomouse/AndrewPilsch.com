  What can the way Facebook writes software---at the level of the code
  itself---teach us about how we argue online?

  This article considers the design of software platforms—emergent, commodified
  digital publics that leverage crowd effects into profit—through the lens of
  “rhetorical code studies” (Brock 2013) to test whether compositional effects
  are algorithmic byproducts. It focuses on Facebook’s Flux architecture. Flux
  is a design pattern—a term borrowed from architecture to denote repeatable
  solutions to reoccurring problems—meant to facilitate feed-forward state
  management, a solution necessary in very-large-scale data-driven applications.
  The article considers Flux, which simplifies a programmer’s expressive
  potential, an example of rhetorical detractio, the process of saying less in
  order to focus audience attention. By exploring Flux as detractio, it is
  possible to make specific arguments about Facebook's role in shaping public
  argumentation. Facebook is often accused of being a space in which it is
  difficult to argue because the software discourages reflection and encourages
  a series of escalating hot takes. Flux removes the process of feedback from
  platform algorithms and contributes to this lack of feedback at the user
  level. The article concludes that rhetorical code study is a crucial
  methodology for studying digital writing that accounts for discursive effects
  and the manufacture of rhetorical situations by platform algorithms at the
  level of the code itself.
