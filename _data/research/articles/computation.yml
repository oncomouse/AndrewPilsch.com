  This chapter considers the relationship between computation and modernist art.
  Specifically, it explores the modernist turn in mathetmatics at the dawn of
  the 20th century and how this turn contributed to the development of
  digital computation as we know it today. From this history, I consider
  modernist engagement with automatic writing in the context of these
  innovations. While automatic writing is primarily considered a response to the
  automation of the body in industrialism, I show that modernist art engages
  with automatic writing as a way of grappling with the automation of the mind
  represented by computation.
