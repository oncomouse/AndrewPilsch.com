  ## Software Used in Development

  This site is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static-site generator for Ruby. It uses [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) for CSS with some help from [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com). The javascript is powered by [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co).

  The research and course information are stored in a flat-file collection of [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) files, with the dynamic elements (the "All My Courses" button) powered by [PHP](http://www.php.net) and [spyc](https://code.google.com/p/spyc/).

  The PDF version of the CV is generated using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) from a template derived from the [markdown-cv](https://github.com/tompollard/markdown-cv) repository.

  The site was designed and coded by Andrew Pilsch.
