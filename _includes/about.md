# About

I am an Associate Professor at [Texas A&M](http://www.tamu.edu) in the [English Department](http://www.english.tamu.edu/). My current research project is a media archaeology of computer bugs. My first book focuses on the [rhetoric of transhumanism](#transhumanism). I am broadly interested in rhetorical constructions of fate and human destiny in response to the radical technological changes of the digital. My research and pedagogical work touches on facets of digital rhetoric, digital humanities, emerging media, and technical communications.
