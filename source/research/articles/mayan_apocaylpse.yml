    Account of the rhetorical life cycle of a meme, specifically accounting the origins, history, and death of the idea of the 2012 Mayan Apocalypse.

    This article argues that cultural memes, idea viruses, have a kind of rhetorical life-cycle that mirrors and comments upon the nature of
    contemporary argumentation in a multidimensional media ecology. In tracing out the contours of this media ecology, this article
    specifically follows the development, spread, and ultimate decline of the popular millenarianist moment: the idea that the world
    will end on December, 21 2012.
