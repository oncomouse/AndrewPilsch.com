short_description: In the age of posthuman rhetoric---concerned with objects and animals, what role does the mineral play in composition?
description: |+
    On a trip to Tucson, I drove by a slag heap from a copper mine. Green from oxidation, the mineral byproducts stood in testament to the rewriting of _geos_ by _bios_, as described by Vladimir Vernadsky. Realizing I wanted to know more about this mine, I pulled out my smart phone to check the GPS. As the eletrons in my phone moved along copper lines, I realized I was completing a circuit: the product of copper mining mapping the byproduct. In this way, I argue, the mineral plays an active, though simulataneously passive and silent, role in the composition process. Using the emerging, post-Deleuzian field of "geophilosophy," this article explores the intersection of writing and the mineral.
