    In the emergent new material turn (NMT) in rhetoric, the predominant focus has been on a democracy or decorum between humans and their non-human allies. In this article, I take issue with this overly rosy focus on coeval relationships, as, I argue, they distract from the fear of extinction (at the hands of collapsing economies, ecosystems, and emergent super-plagues) that, ultimately, motivates NMT in the first place. I suggest problems with a coparticipant model of nonhuman rhetoric, instead offer a theory of inhumanism (a model of a dark or evil rhetoric of objects), and conclude with an examination of the rhetorical figure _skotison_ (Greek for "make it dark") as an example of an inhuman rhetorical practice.
