    In considering the influence of non-living matter on rhetorical agency, rhetoric and composition scholarship has been  fairly effective at capturing potential agential deflections, but only when applied to certain, special, privileged objects. For instance, Roxanne Mountford's concept of &ldquo;rhetorical space,&rdquo; suggests an agential quality to certain, ethos-laden spaces (war memorials, church pulpits, etc.). Similarly, the rich discourse on posthuman composition suggests that digital telecommunication devices such as computers and cell phones dissolve human agency. In both cases, however, the objects that deflect our agency are privileged objects, special categories of stuff that have been granted a place at the rhetorical table. In this paper, however, I borrow a concept from Bruno Latour's philosophy of technology that defines all matter as exerting a &ldquo;swerve&rdquo; on agency. In analyzing the infamous NRA slogan, &ldquo;Guns Don't Kill People, People Kill People,&rdquo; Latour makes the case that the agency of neither gun nor person is particularly clear in a shooting. I extend Latour's analysis by coupling it with insights into rhetoric made possible by philosophical advances in the field of object-oriented ontology.
