  This paper addresses coffee makers as rhetorical emblems of fluid futurity. I analyze representations of coffee machines in science fiction, focusing on Spike Jonze's _Her_ (2013) and William Gibson's _Count Zero_ (1987). In _Her_, Jonze's minimal, unobtrusive future is captured in the proliferation of pour-over coffee makers throughout the film. These devices, ceramic and glass cones that hold a filter and some coffee grounds, purport to do a better job expressing the terroir of the coffee bean. The devices crystallize the film's craft-obsessed, minimal future aesthetic and connect, I argue, to nascent trends today (pour-over coffee was recently profiled in the New York Times). In Gibson's Sprawl Trilogy, his espresso machines---hulking, tarnished, and spewing steam---capture the faded-chrome futurism of the 1980s Cyberpunk movement, whose plots play out amidst the wreckage of 1960s Jet Age futurity. Similar to _Her_, Gibson also prefigures the rise of espresso-driven chain coffee in the 1990s, extrapolating from trends nascent in the Pacific Northwest at the time. Having argued that coffee makers are potent emblems of futurity in science fiction, I argue that the history of coffee making has always been a futurism: from imperfect steam pumps marring the possibility of espresso prior to the introduction of the Gaggia Classica in 1948 to innovations in filter technology throughout the 19th and 20th century, the perfect coffee always exists in the future, always receeds into a cloud of steam and a puddle of murky brown fluid.
