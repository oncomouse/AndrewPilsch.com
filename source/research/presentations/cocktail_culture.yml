    Presentation on primitive-futurism in tiki culture.
description: |+ 
    This paper asks if a cocktail can be racist by looking at the recipes, names, and broader culture of tiki drinks in midcentury America. The obvious and easy reading of tiki culture---that it markets a derogatory image of a primitive and sexually permissive Polynesian culture---while not incorrect, does not fully encapsulate the very odd rhetorical work being done by tiki culture, especially when directly considering the drinks around which the culture organized. With names drawn from the Polynesian language ("Mai Tai," "Nui Nui," "Aku Aku Lapu"), colonial-era Caribbean maritime culture ("Planter's Punch," "Navy Grog," "Fog Cutter"), but also Jet-Age futurism ("Test Pilot," "Coconaut," "Saturn"), the tiki drink embodies a curious cultural formation that collides midcentury American ideas about the future with retrogressive understandings of the primitive. Beyond just the names, however, I argue that the drinks themselves---noted for their extreme complexity and the secrecy that guarded their formulas---embody this complex assemblage of primitive and futuristic. In this paper, I consider the components of a tiki drink and how these embody the complex rhetorical factors that shape this cultural phenomenon. I start by considering the tiki drink from the perspective of the "drink family," an approach to mixology first suggested by Gary Regan in his _The Joy of Mixology_. This concept, hugely important in shaping modern mixology, suggests that bartenders invent new drinks by varying ingredients within set, workable ratios (in the way that The Margarita, The Sidecar, and the Daiquiri are essentially the same drink with differing ingredients). In tiki the drink family, first developed by Don Beach at his Don the Beachcomber chain of restaurants in the 1930s, is based on the classic Jamaican recipe for the Planter's Punch: 1 part sour, 2 parts sweet, 3 parts strong, 4 parts weak (traditionally, lime, sugar, rum, and water). As Jeff "Beachbum" Berry identifies in his books and articles recovering lost tiki recipes, Don Beach manufactured a phalanx of powerful cocktails by varying this basic formula with different combinations of rum and different sweeteners (including the West Indian ginger and lime cordial called falernum, Jamaican pimento dram, and cinnamon syrup). Beach further discovered that the use of the newly invented electric blender---an icon of post-WWII suburban automation---allowed for the incorporation of the weak component in the form of crushed ice (thereby inventing the blended, frozen drink). Armed with this basic formula, Beach and his competitors---most notably "Trader" Vic Bergeron and Steve Crane---went on to market an image of an exotic Polynesia in which patrons consumed drinks based on recipes emerging from the slave trade that were manufactured using iconic jet-age technology. This collision of three images suggests that the Polynesian-pop aesthetic of the tiki drink constitutes a primitive-futurism, equally routed through the rhetorical legacy of British empire and the rhetorical possibilities promised by space-age techno-futurism. I conclude by arguing that this primitive-futurist aesthetic crucially contributed to the articulation of a globally ascendent, post-War American identity.
