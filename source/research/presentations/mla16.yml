    Panel I organized that addresses critical contributions digital humanities makes to the cultural understanding of informatics.

    This panel challenges the often dominant view that digital humanities requires or is focused on rational and realist critical methodologies inherited from computation or the sciences. Coming as a response to the so-called "death of Theory," digital humanists often situate their work in terms more associated with a pre-hermeneutic scholarly approach: "I look at my data and see what's there." This panel challenges this realist bias and its association (as Adeline Koh suggests) with informatic methodologies that were invented for colonialist, capitalist, and anti-privacy purposes. At its core, this panel explores the idea that DH, in addition to reshaping humanities scholarship, is an important site for challenging dominant ideologies of data and the pervasive culture of computational rationality. Borrowing the term "critical informatics" from analysis of the work of information scientist Rob Kling, this panel documents emergent methods for DH that counter informatic realism.
