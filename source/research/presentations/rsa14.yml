    What is the rhetorical agency of the nonhuman? Following work by Thomas Rickert, Scot Barnett, Nathaniel Rivers, and others, this question and the philosophers exploring the status of the object (Bruno Latour, Jane Bennett, and Graham Harman) are increasingly central to a theoretical approach to rhetoric. This object-oriented rhetoric crystalizes the disparate work broadly conceived of as "posthuman rhetoric" by gesturing toward a general nonhuman rhetoric. However, this paper intervenes by suggesting that this posthuman approach still privileges the human as central to persuasion by merely manufacturing the nonhuman as enabling human agency. This paper argues that contemporary reality reveals an alternate theory of persuasion: the inhuman. Drawn from the weird fiction of H.P. Lovecraft, the inhuman—malevolent, extra-human, agential objects—constitutes a proper approach to a nonhuman rhetoric. While rhetoricians talk of nonhuman rhetorical agency in terms of distributions or agglomerations of human agency, the inhuman—entities such as corporations, climates, and diseases—constitutes a truly nonhuman rhetorical agency on equal footing with the human.
