In his famously influential essay "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" (a name that Singapore apparently still can't escape), William Gibson concludes his account of his trip to the tiny nation with an account of his return to Hong Kong's sprawling chaos, contrasting the city with his experiences of the manicured, postmodern police state of Singapore:

> In Hong Kong I'd seen huge matte black butterflies flapping around the customs hall, nobody paying them the least attention. I'd caught a glimpse of the Walled City of Kowloon, too. Maybe I could catch another, before the future comes to tear it down.
>
> Traditionally the home of pork-butchers, unlicensed denturists, and dealers in heroin, the Walled City still stands at the foot of a runway, awaiting demolition. Some kind of profound embarassment to modern China, its clearance has long been made a condition of the looming change of hands.
>
> Hive of dream. Those mismatched, uncalculated windows. How they seemed to absorb all the frantic activity of Kai Tak airport, sucking in energy like a black hole.
>
> I was ready for something like that. . . .
>
> I loosened my tie, clearing Singapore airspace.

I've been thinking a lot about this passage, as I recently played through [Shadowrun Returns](http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun/)

> This tragic curbing of _popular rights_, which signals the fundamental reversal that is currently occurring on a ruined planet, where _there will soon be nothing left to take_. We need to be in no doubt that, more than ever in the twenty-first century, the abandonment of the old _anthropocentrism_ will be on the agenda. With the appearance of new forms of bio-political conditioning, in which the _other_ will no longer be considered as an _alter ego_, nor even as a potential enemy (with whom reconciliation is always possible), but as the ultimate quarry. Nietzsche had, in his day, predicted the imminent arrival of this new misanthropy -- _an anthropophagy which would have no particular ritual_ as he put it. Unless ... unless the revolutionary innovations of the biotechnologies, by abolishing the last taboos of a degenerate humanism, have not already taken us, without our knowing it, into this new biocracy.[^1]
