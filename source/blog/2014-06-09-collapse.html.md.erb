I've been recently reading a lot about climate change and discourses such as [dark ecology](http://slowlorisblog.wordpress.com/2014/05/20/dark-ecology-as-the-higher-misanthropy/) in prepping for what I'm anticipating as my second book project, about happy topics such as the death drive, climate collapse, and H.P. Lovecraft. One thing I've noticed, recently, is a similarity between discourses about climate change and about the collapse of the academic humanities in the American university system. Beyond participating in the general rhetoric of collapse that marks our era, though, I think these two issues are remarkably similar. Specifically, I'm interested in the "standing ideally by" rhetoric that marks both crises.

One of the most interesting (if I can call the always, already imminent collapse of the field in which I work "interesting") about the ongoing fight over the collapse of academic humanities is the argument that the [Modern Languages Association](http://mla.org) (MLA) has done nothing and will continue to do nothing about the various factors impacting this perceived collapse.[^1] For instance, take this quote from [Rebecca Schuman's](http://pankisseskafka.com/) ["Report on the MLA Report of the Task Force on Doctoral Study in Modern Language and Literature"](http://pankisseskafka.com/2014/05/31/schumans-report-on-the-mla-report-of-the-task-force-on-doctoral-study-in-modern-language-and-literature/):

> And second, the MLA is defined to me (and other marginalized academics, as well as those few tenureds, such as Mark Bousquet, who speak up for us) by its membership’s total hand-wringing ineffectuality, which frets about “adjunctification” in general terms, but simultaneously insists that it’s most effective to make “change from the inside” and yet *refuses to do a single goddamned thing* to change the fate of adjuncts in their own departments across the country. *(emphasis in original)*

Responses (including Schuman's) to [The MLA's report](http://www.mla.org/report_doctoral_study_2014) on the state of doctoral studies are but the most recent example of this phenomenon: the idea that the MLA is not doing nearly enough to solve the myriad of problems corroding the academic humanities.

In contrast to some of Schuman's other invective (but related to this "MLA is useless" trope), former MLA president Michael Bérubé used his presidential address at the 2014 MLA Convention to highlight work he and the MLA has been doing for this issue. As [William Pannapecker summarizes](http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/01/06/what-if-the-adjuncts-shrugged/),

> Back in the 90s, Bérubé helped make it possible to talk about academe’s labor practices through writings such as *Higher Education Under Fire* (1994) and *The Employment of English* (1997).  I remember that Bérubé---along with Cary Nelson and Paul Lauter---was prominent among a small group of faculty who gave moral support and leadership to graduate students, like me, who were questioning the legitimacy of an educational system that talked about “the life of mind” while using its students to teach thousands of composition courses on the cheap.

As Pannapecker goes on to summarize, however, the MLA (which is not a governing body), only

> can suggest a $6,800 minimum wage for college teaching, the organization can’t dictate policies to individual institutions. Bérubé exhorted the MLA membership to use any position of power that we might have to work towards a more equitable labor system. 

I want to make it clear that I'm not taking a side in this issue. The MLA claims to represent the issues of adjuncts but also has no power to act. The MLA advocates for improved conditions but those on the ground suggest that the time for advocacy has passed. The collapse is ongoing, action is needed.

Which brings me to climate change. While the crisis humanities have been a part of my entire working life, the idea that pollution from human actions is inducing a massive (and potential life-extinguishing) change to global climate has been circulating my entire life. In recent years, however, [screwy winter weather](http://science.time.com/2014/01/06/climate-change-driving-cold-weather/) and [increased violent hurricanes](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes) have suggested that this period of climate advocacy, like the 1990s, has passed and that the time of climate action has come.

However, as Ezra Klein rather convincingly pointed out last week, [there are at least 7 very good reasons we will fail to prevent massive and devastating climate change](http://www.vox.com/2014/6/5/5779040/7-reasons-America-fail-global-warming). The most interesting to me is his claim that "the kind of international cooperation (and, perhaps, international redistribution) required to pass, implement and verify viable carbon caps is completely unprecedented, at least outside of wartime."

Given this dark prediction and that, basically, as I mentioned, this discourse has been around at least my whole life, the

To conclude, I want to suggest that if you want to see what the next twenty years of geopolitics look like, the collapse of the humanities and the retroactive blaming of the MLA (whether right or wrong) is probably a good microcosm for thinking this through.

[^1]: For those of you not following along at home, there has been an ongoing war of words since I've been involved in the academic humanities about the idea that this field is collapsing. Several associated trends are declining funding within the university, curricular marginalization, increasing reliance on low-payed, benefits-less adjunct (non-tenure-track) labor, and a massive decline in available tenure-track jobs that has been met with an *increase* in PhDs being granted in these fields.
