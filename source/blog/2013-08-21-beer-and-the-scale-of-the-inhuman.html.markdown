## Human Scale and Cramped Space

* Deleuze and Guattari, "cramped space" of minor literature. "The individual concern thus becomes all the more necessary, indispensable, magnified, because a whole other story is vibrating within it" (_Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature_ 17).
* Deleuze: "Creation takes place in choked passages" (_Negotiations_ 133).

* Lovecraft
