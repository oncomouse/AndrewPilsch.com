In a meeting with [Rich Doyle](http://mobiused.wordpress.com/) when I was writing my dissertation, he was enthusing about a Kindle he'd recently purchased and the device's possibility to remake the field of literary studies. Specifically, Rich was excited about the wide availablity of [public domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) texts. Specifically, though, he said that "really, we should be using whatever's available there as the canon."

The idea that the English literary canon should be tied to public domain texts really stuck with me and I've implemented a public-domain-friendly approach in a class I'm teaching this semester, called [Major American Novels](http://andrew.pilsch.com/courses/eng337fall2013/). Of the 9 texts in the class, 6 of them are available in the public domain (and a seventh is available in Australia).

So far, this has made teaching this class a breeze and I wanted to talk briefly about what I'm doing, what I plan on doing, and the problems I foresee.

## The "Free Is a Very Good Price" Literature Survey

I don't like that students have to spend a lot of money on books for my classes. Is this something other people worry about? I would hope so.

Given my ruminating over Rich's remark about the Kindle, the commons, and the canon, when I was given the opportunity to teach a course on the American novel (as part of a larger initiative to get more DH projects into our core curriculum), I jumped at the opportunity to use as many free texts as possible. Besides, with a survey of the American novel, _most_ of the texts are going to be published before 1923, anyway.

Students in my class read 9 texts:

1. _The Scarlet Letter_ by Nathaniel Hawthorne (1850)
1. "Bartleby the Scrivener" by Herman Melville (1853)
1. _The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_ by Mark Twain (1885)
1. _Daisy Miller_ by Henry James (1878)
1. _The House of Mirth_ by Edith Wharton (1905)
1. _My √Åntonia_ by Willa Cather (1918)
1. _The Great Gatsby_ by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925)
1. _Invisible Man_ by Ralph Ellison (1952)
1. _Blood Meridian_ by Cormac Mccarthy (1985)

As you can see, 6 of those texts are in the public domain. I'm very happy that my students can buy as many or as few texts as they want for my class (though they still have to buy the last three).

The interesting thing about this cost-saving is that it's actually made teaching class much easier.

## In-Class Discussion

The biggest overall insight from teaching a commons-friendly literature survey is this: **You have the texts.**

Once I really thought through the implication of this simple statement, I realized I was really on to something.

Increasingly, with students using Kindles and the like to buy and read their texts, class discussion has become very difficult. Even though they "have" the same edition as my print version, the page numbers don't match up.

With a commons-friendly survey, who cares? **Everyone already has the text**.

The first way this has changed my classroom structure is rather radical, but maybe not on the surface: I'm using Powerpoint!

While Powerpoint is the worst thing to happen to information design ever, I'm using an online slideshow program called [Remark](http://remarkjs.com/) to make simple slides that merely have the quotes I want to talk about with my students in the order in which I want to discuss them.

You can see my slides for this class here: [My Slides](http://oncomouse.github.io/slides/eng337).

Each slide has one quote and, in the event of a novel, the chapter it comes from. Students can look at the slides or pull the quotes up in their Kindles or whatever. The text is just right there and so accessible.

It also makes preparing for class easy, as putting the slides in sequence (and building an agenda slide) not only forces me to gather the quotes I want to discuss but also helps flesh out the argument about the book that I plan to present.

## Public Domain and DH Pedagogy

The public domain has already been well established as a boon for the digital humanities on the research end of our profession, but I think it's important to also think about how these same access protocols can enhance our teaching.

## Citational Hell

One thing I am dreading is the first research paper. In my class, students [complete three assignments](http://andrew.pilsch.com/courses/eng337fall2013/assignments.html), the first of which is a traditional thematic analysis. The moment you abandon a specific text for The Text presented by the commons, you realize the complete and utter uselessness of citational systems, in this context.

Similar to how the MLA dropped the requirement to include a URL in a web citation on the assumption [that readers can just Google it](http://lmgtfy.com/), with a fairly standard text (and I realize there's a lot of textual scholars out there who can point to numerous texts where this is a huge issue), why do you need to know the page number in a specific edition?

I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to solve this, yet, but I'm hoping to come up with something before the first assignment goes live in a few days. Ultimately, though, this issue with citations (which everyone agrees basically ruin everything, anyway, right?) is a small price to pay for the profound ways focusing on public domain texts in a literature survey can radically reconfigure the possibilities for classroom engagement in the era of Big Data.
