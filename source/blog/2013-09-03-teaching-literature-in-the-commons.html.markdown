In a meeting with [Rich Doyle](http://mobiused.wordpress.com/) when I was writing my dissertation, he was enthusing about a Kindle he'd recently purchased and the device's possibility to remake the field of literary studies. Specifically, Rich was excited about the wide availablity of [public domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) texts. Specifically, though, he said that "really, we should be using whatever's available there as the canon."

The idea that the English literary canon should be tied to public domain texts really stuck with me and I've implemented a public-domain-friendly approach in a class I'm teaching this semester, called [Major American Novels](http://andrew.pilsch.com/courses/eng337fall2013/). Of the 9 texts in the class, 6 of them are available in the public domain (and a seventh is available in Australia).

So far, this has made teaching this class a breeze and I wanted to talk briefly about what I'm doing, what I plan on doing, and the problems I foresee.
