				This blog was made using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) with [middleman-blog](http://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/) activated. Additionally, code highlighting is done by [middleman-syntax](https://github.com/middleman/middleman-syntax) and related content is calculated using [middleman-blog-similar](https://github.com/ngs/middleman-blog-similar).
				
				HTML was created in [HAML](http://haml.info/) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (specifically using [kramdown's](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) excellent Markdown extensions). Some design patterns copied from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Icons are from [Genericons](http://genericons.com/).
				
				Stylesheets were made in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) with help from [Goldilocks](http://goldilocksapproach.com/) for responsive design, [Typebase](https://devinhunt.github.io/typebase.css/) for typography, [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) for Sass tools, [Breakpoints](http://breakpoint-sass.com/) for setting breakpoints, and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) for grids.
