The thread was tagged "riyl Junior Boys," so of course I clicked on it. RIYL, for those of you not familiar with the slang of file-sharing means "Recommended If You Like." At the time (as today), I was really into Junior Boys, although I thought _So This is Goodbye_ was inferior to _Last Exit_. In any case, I was going to download and listen to this record.

Little did I realize, however, that when I downloaded a copy of Nicolas Makelberge's _Dying in Africa_, I would be encountering what I consider the best album no one has ever heard of.

Discuss Nicolas Makelberge in the context of MP3 sharing.
