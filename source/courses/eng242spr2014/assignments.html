            In this class we will be exploring the history of American literature from 1860 to the present.
            Additionally, we will be looking at ways to quantify American literature using emerging computational 
            tools to study these texts.

        <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
        
        <p>For this assignment, you will be creating an online-aware, annotated edition of one of the texts we have read so far (from “How To Tell A Story” to “A New England Nun”). As these texts are freely available in the public domain, you can copy and paste them as you see fit. Specifically, for this assignment, you will be using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>—an easy language for creating web content—to create online editions. These annotated editions will link to other, online resources that clarify, explain, and enrich our experience of the text. </p>
        
        <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to use</em> White Fang <em>for this assignment, select a chapter to annotate.</em></p>

        <ol>
          <li>Familiarize yourself with Markdown. If you’ve never used this sort of tool, it allows you to create a well-structured, online document with a minimum of fuss.

          <li>Start a Markdown document. There are a number of programs that can edit Markdown documents, but here are a few good ones:

        <p>For this assignment, you will be exploring a variety of online tools that provided statistical information about a text. Provided with a list of these tools, you will then create a lab-style report detailing, in a paragraph or two, what you learned by looking at a text of your choosing from that particular tool.</p>

        <h3 id="description-2">Description</h3>
        
        <p>For this final assignment, we will explore the ways in which American literature can map the spaces of the American city. In <em>Cotton Comes to Harlem</em>, as in most detective novels, the hyper-specific listing of locations and spaces creates the novel’s verisimilitude. Additionally, in Himes’s use of shifting perspective to follow various characters as the violence of the novel unfolds, we have the ability to create a map of the tragic intersections of the various characters.</p>
        
        <p>To do this, you will be using <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/">Google Maps Engine</a>. For each of the major characters in Himes’s novel, you will plot out their movements over the course of the book. At each major point, detail what happens and your best guess as to the time at which it happens. In order to do this, you will need to rely not only on the information Himes gives you but also some of your own research. For instance, for locations such as the Cotton Club, you will have to find out where it was located in New York City. Also, be aware that several streets in Harlem have since been renamed.</p>

        <p>During the course of the semester, we will be blogging together about the texts we are reading. Each student will be responsible for leading this online discussion <strong>three times</strong> during the course of the term.</p>
        
        <p>When it is your time to be the blog author for a class period, you must have read your texts and posted an ~500 word response to the class blog by 11:59PM on the day before class (Mondays and Wednesdays). For these responses, you may need to do some additional reading about the history of the text and the biography of the author. For everyone else in class (including me), we will need to read your entry and offer a substantive comment on it before class starts on the following day. </p>
        
        <p>We will use these posts as starting points for any class discussions, so it is important that in your blog posts, you identify themes and ideas you find interesting in the works you have read. Do you find the style of a particular poet to be interesting? Did you find the content to be interesting? Do you want more background on a particular short story and wish to provide it? How you approach this is up to you, but, importantly, you will be responsible for setting the terms for our discussion in class. You have to be thorough and handle this responsibility with care.</p>
        
        <p>I will blog for the first week in class to show you some idea of what’s expected.</p>
