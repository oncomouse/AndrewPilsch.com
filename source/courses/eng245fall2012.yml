course_term: Fall 2012
course_description:
    This course explores the continuing and rising popularity of post-apocalyptic narratives in contemporary popular culture.
    Through a selection of novels (<em>The Road</em>, <em>Year of the Flood</em>, etc.) and television (<em>Battlestar 
    Galactica</em>, <em>The Walking Dead</em>, etc.), students explore why our culture is still so obsessed with our own
    ends.
