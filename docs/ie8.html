While transhumanism is usually dismissed by scholars of rhetoric, technology, and culture as a fringe movement with limited scope, my project instead argues that “transhumanism” is a name for a much more pervasive rhetorical mode that considers technology as a vector for evolutionary change operating on society, consciousness, and biology. I call this rhetorical mode “evolutionary futurism,” and, in tracing this formation throughout 20th and 21st century culture, I suggest that transhumanism, rather than a fringe movement of renegade scientists and philosophers, is actually a postmodern form of Utopia in line with Fredric Jameson’s discussion of the concept in <em>Postmodernism</em>.</p> <p>My book then traces the rhetorical, Utopian mode I call “evolutionary futurism” through a number of important moments in the 20th and 21st centuries.</p> <p><strong>Chapters Summaries</strong></p> <ol> <li>The first chapter considers the origin of evolutionary futurism in continental modernism. Specifically, the chapter traces out the reception of Nietzsche’s <em>übermensch</em> as a figure for radical evolution rather than enlightened self-interest. Theosophist P.D. Ouspensky and Futurist Mina Loy are considered as guides for this particular uptake of Nietzsche.</li> <li>The second chapter explores evolutionary futurist rhetoric in pre-WWII American science fiction during the “superman boom,” my term for the period immediately before and during the start of the war in which John W. Campbell solicited a considerable mass of stories about genetically evolved superhumans for his magazines. Concomitant to this publishing fad, SF fan culture also became intersted in actualizing this evolutionary futurist in its calls for an evolved “fannationalism.”</li> <li>The third chapter is about the role of suffering and hedonism in an evolutionary futurism. Questioning the dominant transhuman rhetorical mode in which evolving beyond the human will be blissful, I explore the thinking of Teilhard de Chardin, the Jesuit who first coined the term “transhuman” in its modern usage, as a model for an evolutionary vanguard not tied to dubious notions of winner-take-all evolution.</li> <li>The fourth chapter asks after aesthetics and evolutionary futurism. In the realm of high art, I consider the impact of Natasha Vita-More’s manifesto for transhuman art and the work of Arakawa and Gins, who adopt principles of evolutionary futurist rhetoric to art and architecture. I juxtapose this aesthetic with the “transhuman inaesthetic,” my term for the often bland and beige futurism of transhumanists such as Raymond Kurzweil and Zoltan Istvan. Finally, I conclude by arguing that this inaesthetic blinds many transhumanists to the evolutionary futurist aspects of online “low art” movements, such as meme culture.</li> <li>The book concludes by discussing accelerationism and xenofeminism as recent examples of imagining an evolutionary futurist vanguard politics.</li> </ol> </div> </div> <!-- Begin #find_me --> <div class='box col1 no-mobile no-click blog' id=find_me> <h2>Other Places to Find Me Online</h2> <div class=social_badges> <a class=icon_twitter href='https://twitter.com/oncomouse' target=_blank title='Find Me on Twitter'> <i class='fa fa-4x fa-twitter'></i> <div class=sr-only>I'm oncomouse on Twitter.

This period, which I call the “superman boom,” was a transitional one for both fandom and the culture of professional writers. As an autonomous fan culture began to articulate itself, John W. Campbell’s rise as the editor of <em>Astounding</em> also gave shape to the idea that SF could be taken seriously as an artform. This superman boom, an almost endless stream of stories and novels varying the themes of a genetically superior but persecuted elite taken from A.E. van Vogt’s hugely popular 1939 novel <em>Slan</em>, suggested a number of interesting political engagements, including early involvement by SF writers in Alfred Korzybski’s General Semantics program and the creation of a number of fan-organized Utopian communities. These movements, oddly, coincide with the dawn of World War II and borrow heavily from the fascist rhetoric of America’s enemies, culminating in fan Claude Degler labelling, in all seriousness, this period as the moment of “fanationalism.” Inevitably, the ethical tensions this association with Nazism provoked proved unsustainable, but the also point toward the potent moment of emergence for what we now recognize as SF fan culture.</p> </div> </div> <div id=es6 class="col1 expand box research article no-excerpt"> <div class=hideable> <h2> Forthcoming Article </h2> <p> <img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" alt="Image Illustrating the article, &quot;Translating the Future&quot;" data-original="/images/research/es6.png" data-image-width=422 data-image-height=270 class=lazy /> </p> <h1> Translating the Future </h1> <p class=single-spaced> Forthcoming in <a href="http://amodern.net/"><em>Amodern</em></a> </p> <p>Article theorizing the use of ES6 transpilers (Babel &amp; Traceur) in contemporary JavaScript as examples of novel machine translation systems.</p> </div> <div class=expandable> <div class=mobile> <h2>Forthcoming Article</h2> </div> <h1>Translating the Future: Transpilers and the New Temporalities of Programming in JavaScript </h1> <p><strong>Forthcoming in <a href="http://amodern.net/"><em>Amodern</em></a></strong></p> <p>This article discusses the use of translating compilers (transpilers) such as Babel &amp; Traceur, which are used to implement the recently approved ES6 standard for JavaScript, represents a novel temporality for translation.

Instead of a model of object rhetoric focused on rhetorical carpentry (Brown and Rivers), a strategy that proposes the enlistment of simulating objects to understand the nonhuman, this article nominates Lanham’s concept of <em>skotison</em>—deliberately obfuscatory speech—as a key figure for rhetorically invoking these boundless agencies. Rhetorical invocation provides a strategy for thinking about the rhetoric of the inhuman, rather than the nonhuman, which is the more salient object for an extra-human rhetorical theory in our current age of horrors.</p> </div> </div> <div id=insect-capital class="col1 expand box research article no-excerpt"> <div class=hideable> <h2> Published Article </h2> <p> <img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" alt="Image Illustrating the article, &quot;Insect Capital&quot;" data-original="/images/research/insect-capital.png" data-image-width=422 data-image-height=350 class=lazy /> </p> <h1> Insect Capital </h1> <p class=single-spaced> Published in <a href="http://www.nanocrit.com"><em>New American Notes Online</em></a>, 8 (December 2015) </p> <p>Uses the pattern of insect imagery in William Gibson’s <em>Neuromancer</em> to talk about a theory of corporate culture informed by German Media Studies.</p> <p><a href="http://www.nanocrit.com/issues/8-2015/insect-capital">Read the article online</a>.</p> </div> <div class=expandable> <div class=mobile> <h2>Published Article</h2> </div> <h1>Insect Capital </h1> <p><strong>Published in <a href="http://www.nanocrit.com"><em>New American Notes Online</em></a>, 8 (December 2015)</strong></p> <p>Tracing an inhuman theory of the corporation, this article uses Friedrich Kittler’s understandings of media (that they shape humans, not the other way around) to argue that the corporation in postmodern, cyberpunk literature is a media form for adapting the human to the inhuman registers of global data.

I base Loy’s informatic futurism on discoveries made in translating her typographic fractals into HTML for online consumption. Loy’s usage of an informatic machine critiques both the masculine ethos of her Futurist interlocutors but also interrogates the rational afterlives of this machismo in web design practices that inherits principles developed by avant-garde movements. Thus Loy’s poetic account of machinic being serves as a potent site for exploring and resisting informatic rationality in the present.</p> <p>Collection is edited by Shawna Ross and James O’Sullivan and published by Palgrave.</p> </div> </div> <div class=' col1 expand box research presentation no-excerpt emphasize' data-timestamp=1452146400 id=mla16> <div class=hideable> <h2>Recent Presentation</h2> <p> <img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" alt="Image Illustrating the presentation, &quot;Critical Informatics and the Digital Humanities&quot;" data-original="/images/research/mla16.png" data-image-width=960 data-image-height=500 class=lazy /> </p> <h1>Critical Informatics and the Digital Humanities </h1> <p>Panel I organized that addresses critical contributions digital humanities makes to the cultural understanding of informatics.</p> </div> <div class=expandable> <div class=mobile> <h2>Recent Presentation</h2> </div> <h1>Critical Informatics and the Digital Humanities </h1> <p><strong>Presentation At</strong>: <em><a href="http://www.mla.org/convention">The Modern Languages Association Convention</a></em>, Austin, TX, 2016 This panel challenges the often dominant view that digital humanities requires or is focused on rational and realist critical methodologies inherited from computation or the sciences. Coming as a response to the so-called “death of Theory,” digital humanists often situate their work in terms more associated with a pre-hermeneutic scholarly approach: “I look at my data and see what’s there.” This panel challenges this realist bias and its association (as Adeline Koh suggests) with informatic methodologies that were invented for colonialist, capitalist, and anti-privacy purposes. At its core, this panel explores the idea that DH, in addition to reshaping humanities scholarship, is an important site for challenging dominant ideologies of data and the pervasive culture of computational rationality.

Bifo argues that this movement was ethical and never a vector for social change because it was incapable of imagining a future in which an alternative to neoliberal brutality held sway. For Bifo, this diagnosis suggests a failure of the collective conscious imaginary of the future itself, hence his claim that the myth of the future is now over. In offering a genealogy of this myth and an account of its failure, Bifo connects the emergence of the future as a space of promise and prosperity to the emergence of capitalism and heavy industry itself. However, I suggest that a much older rhetorical concept offers a different and, in the context of Bifo’s autonomist Marxism, more relevant model of the future. The sophistic concept of <em>plasma</em> is a genre in which a better or at least different world is extrapolated from current data. In contrast to the deceptive and intentionally false <em>pseudos</em>, <em>plasma</em> articulates a myth of a future by making the current world virtual. For the sophists, <em>plasma</em> is a source of positive invention, just as the myth of the future was needed to animate the struggle for spaces autonomous from capital’s privations. Thus, Bifo’s diagnosis signals the failure of <em>plasma</em> in our present argumentation. Through this figure of an imagined world, I link Bifo’s diagnosis of the soul as the site of capitalist exploitation with accounts of cybernetic sophistry from Richard Lanham and Jeff Pruchnic to highlight the terrain upon which rhetoricians can reinvigorate the idea of a plasmatic invention in the age of semiocapital.</p> </div> </div> <div class=' col1 expand box research presentation no-excerpt emphasize' data-timestamp=1464411600 id=rsa16-teargas> <div class=hideable> <h2>Recent Presentation</h2> <p> <img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" alt="Image Illustrating the presentation, &quot;*Lachrymator*: Persuasion's Tear Gas&quot;" data-original="/images/research/rsa16-teargas.png" data-image-width=420 data-image-height=219 class=lazy /> </p> <h1><em>Lachrymator</em>: Persuasion’s Tear Gas </h1> <p>Presentation that samples theories of the political object from Africana Studies to account for non-democratic displays of public rhetoric.</p> </div> <div class=expandable> <div class=mobile> <h2>Recent Presentation</h2> </div> <h1><em>Lachrymator</em>: Persuasion’s Tear Gas </h1> <p><strong>Presentation At</strong>: <em><a href="http://associationdatabase.com/aws/RSA/pt/sp/conferences">17th Biennial RSA Conference</a></em>, Atlanta, GA, 2016</p> <p>This paper experiments with the role of democracy in the rhetoric of objects. Where “being moved to tears” is often associated with experiences of <em>pathos</em>, recent brutal police responses in American cities figure being moved to tears as the product of an involuntary bodily response produced tear gas. Considering such a substance—scientifically designed for the sole purpose of producing pain—serves as a limit case for the commitments of an object-oriented rhetoric. Through theoretical metaphors of carpentry (Bogost), parliament (Latour), and ambience (Rickert), the conceptual vector for considering the rhetoricity of nonhumans is inclusivity: bringing objects to the table of a deliberative, democratic rational persuasion. As tear gas rains down on protesters across America, this paper asks if democratic deliberation is the best model for thinking about the rhetoric of <em>these</em> objects. Further, this paper constructs a “dark persuasion” following a thread of horror from OOO (Harman, Morton) to an emerging weird philosophy of horror (Negastrani, Thacker, Ligotti). Thinking darkly about nonhuman rhetoric constructs objects as producers of rhetorical effects not through calm deliberation but through violent collision. In this dark rhetoric of objects, we find responses like Bree Newsome’s removal of the South Carolina flag to be <em>the</em> rhetorical strategy for dealing with the darkness of rhetorical objects.</p> </div> </div> <div class=' col1 expand box research presentation no-excerpt' data-timestamp=1447480800 id=slsa15> <div class=hideable> <h2>Recent Presentation</h2> <p> <img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" alt="Image Illustrating the presentation, &quot;Worlds Without Us&quot;" data-original="/images/research/slsa15.png" data-image-width=518 data-image-height=270 class=lazy /> </p> <h1>Worlds Without Us </h1> <p>Eco-horror, modernity, VanderMeer</p> </div> <div class=expandable> <div class=mobile> <h2>Recent Presentation</h2> </div> <h1>Worlds Without Us: The Horror of Indifference in The Southern Reach Trilogy </h1> <p><strong>Presentation At</strong>: <em><a href="http://litsciarts.org/slsa15/">The Society For Literature, Science, and the Arts 2014 Conference</a></em>, Houston, TX, 2015 In Jeff VanderMeer’s <em>Southern Reach Trilogy</em> (<em>Annihilation</em>, <em>Authority</em>, <em>Acceptance</em>, all 2014), the style and language of H.P.

VanderMeer’s trilogy—involving the attempts to scientifically and bureaucratically manage an alien-created, pristine natural environment on the coast of the Southern US—clearly engages these tropes but, I argue, toward different ends. Rust and Soles argue that ecohorror—defined more capaciously than the popular definition as “revenge of nature” narratives—uses horror to foreground ecological politics and sensibilities. However, I argue that VanderMeer is focusing not on a notion of nature but on the human itself as a vector for producing horror: his unsettling descriptions of a seemingly pure natural world evoke a clear sense of our post-natural realities. Rather than produce an ecological awareness, VanderMeer’s ecohorror produces an awareness of our own inability to produce an ecological vision in the Anthropocene. By creating an ecology that does not reference the human, and using this ecosystem as a vector for weird horror, VanderMeer’s trilogy captures an inhuman vision of the natural, non-human world as, to use Eugene Thacker’s term for the truly horrifying, a “world-without-us.”</p> </div> </div> <h1 class=section>Teaching</h1> <!-- Begin #podcasting --> <div class='expand col1 box teaching' id=podcasting> <div class=hideable> <img src="data:image/.gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAANvf7wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" width=240 height=177 alt="Podcasting Logo (RSS Icon w/ Headphones)" data-original="images/thumbs/podcasting.png" data-image-width=240 data-image-height=177 class=lazy /> <h1>Podcasting</h1> <p>Read about my use of podcasting in the humanities classroom ...</p> </div> <div class=expandable> <h1>Humanities Podcasting</h1> <p>While teaching at <a href="http://sls.asu.edu/ihc">Arizona State</a>, I used podcasting for online sections of American literature and several digital humanities classes.

In my dissertation, I write about "transhumanism," a discursive community aimed at grappling with humans as objects of ongoing evolutionary processes. Often, these evolutionary processes have, specifically, to do with the evolutionary pressures exerted by new and emerging, digital technologies. As such, my motivation as a teacher is to better equip my students to deal with these pressures. Overall, I view my teaching as a chance to direct students in ways of living in a digital media ecology and preparing them for a future of ongoing, accelerating technological change.</p> <p>This goal expresses itself differently, depending on the class being taught. For instance, in teaching Technical Communication, which I have done four times so far, I made an interesting discovery regarding my students and their attitudes towards writing. In conducting classroom discussion, I found that, thanks to Penn State&#8217;s various internship and co-op programs, my students mostly had experience writing in a professional, scientific capacity. What they lacked, however, was basic knowledge of digital document production. As such, I've retooled my teaching of this subject to focus on combining content production <em>and</em> document design. In this fashion, students spend as much time focusing on <em>how</em> they write as on <em>what</em> they write. The class includes assignments in both report writing and webpage design. I find that students benefit more from this approach, as they can leave my course with marketable, new media skills in addition to a better understanding of the rhetorical stakes of technical writing. More importantly, I stress the importance of developing digital problem solving strategies, rather than specific tool use, so that students in my classes can be better prepared for a changing, evolving digital workplace.</p> <p>My teaching of science fiction, which is a new experience for me, affords another opportunity for dealing pedagogically with the tenants of transhumanism. Where the technical communications classroom becomes a workshop for applied transhumanism, I view the science fiction classroom as focusing on the philosophical implications of this discourse. By focusing on close analysis of various texts that grapple with the nature of a radically altered future, I attempt to direct students toward thinking seriously about the ethical, moral, and philosophical issues raised by the rapid technological change experienced by the United States following World War II (which corresponds to the high point of American SF). Additionally, as many of these processes of change and acceleration are ongoing (especially with regards to emerging Internet technologies and mobile computing), I view science fiction pedagogy as an opportunity to raise my students' awareness that the issues raised in SF are, increasingly, being raised in their lives and their futures.</p> <p>In both of these cases, I find focusing on the ongoing evolution of the human condition, by viewing my pedagogy from a transhuman perspective, both personally rewarding and hugely beneficial to my students in the classroom and beyond. While also helping them learn the course material at hand, my transhuman perspective allows students to step out of the classroom and the university with highly valuable "take-away" skills that can be applied in their future lives as students and as professionals. As such, I look forward to continue to explore this perspective in new and exciting pedagogical environments.</p> </div> </div> <!-- End #teaching_philosophy --> <!--Begin #cv--> <div id=cv class="expand col1 box research teaching"> <div class=hideable> <h1 class=cv>CV</h1> <p>View my CV.</p> </div> <div class=expandable> <h1 id=cv_title>CV</h1> <div id=cv_html> <div class=cv-preamble><h1 class=centered>Andrew Pilsch</h1> <p class=centered> <strong>Assistant Professor of English</strong><br> Department of English<br> Texas A&M University<br> </p> <p class=centered> <noscript>'+'&#97;&#112;&#105;&#108;&#115;&#99;&#104;'+'@'+'&#116;&#97;&#109;&#117;.&#101;&#100;&#117;'+'<br/><small>&#97;&#112;&#105;&#108;&#115;&#99;&#104;(at)&#116;&#97;&#109;&#117;.&#101;&#100;&#117;</small></noscript> <script>
