  This project algorithmically generates an example of what Desiderius Erasmus called a copia. Specifically, it randomly iterates through copious versions of the famous excuse "My dog ate my homework." You can also follow this flowing stream of eloquence at [@HomeworkCopia](https://twitter.com/HomeworkCopia)).

  In De Copia, Erasmus suggests practicing the "abundant style" by imagining copious variation on given phrases. Famously, Erasmus offers 195 variations on the sentence "Your Letter Pleased Me Greatly" as an example of stylistic abundance in De Copia. James J Brown, Jr. argues in ["The Machine That I Therefore Am"](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_rhetoric/v047/47.4.brown.html) that Erasmus's copia are tiny rhetorical algorithms and, as an example, discusses [@YourLetterBot](https://twitter.com/YourLetterBot), which produces further versions of pleased letter recipients.
