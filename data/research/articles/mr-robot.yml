description: |+
    This article considers *Mr. Robot* as an important moment in the presentation of the outsider ethos in contemporary cultural texts. Specifically, the article doubly considers the show's presentation of the hacker as a revolutionary outsider, co-opting the language and imagery of the collective Anonymous and it's situatedness as part of USA Network's successful corporate rebranding as an edgier network that appeals to millenials. By considering the show's blatant commodification of dissent, the article asks after the true shape of anti-corporate ethos in the present and questions the revolutionary potential of popular entertainment in a network, globalized era.
