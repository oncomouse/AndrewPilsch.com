short_description: What role has copyright played in shaping the literary and scholarly reputation of American postmodernism?
description: |+
    This work explores the impact of America's draconian copyright laws on the shape and understanding of literary canonicity, particularly w/r/t the canonization (or failure of canonization) of the post-World-War-II American novel, aka the postmodern novel. While not explicitly an argument about postmodernism or its legacy (or lack of legacy), this article instead considers the role of copyright in both shaping a post-War American canon and also, more importantly, erasing a potentially broader canon of the postmodern, American novel.

    In the course of this argument, I consider the percentage of Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winners still in print. Additionally, I consider similar percentages for the examples used in canonical works of postmodern literary criticism (by Fredric Jameson and Brian McHale). Ultimately, I establish that the narrative of postmodern failure may actually have more to do with publication rights than any issues of artistic merit.
