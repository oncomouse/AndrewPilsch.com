short_description: Chapter on Loy, HTML, and the emergence of contemporary information.
description: |+  
  This chapter argues that Mina Loy---avant-garde poet, fierce critic of Italian futurism, collage artist, and mystic---anticipates in her poetry written between 1910 and 1930 the turn from a concept of the machine as physical to the machine as information, a transformation also developed in 20th century Marxist thought. I base Loy's informatic futurism on discoveries made in translating her typographic fractals into HTML for online consumption. Loy's usage of an informatic machine critiques both the masculine ethos of her Futurist interlocutors but also interrogates the rational afterlives of this machismo in web design practices that inherits principles developed by avant-garde movements. Thus Loy's poetic account of machinic being serves as a potent site for exploring and resisting informatic rationality in the present.
