    Drawn from my [first book](#transhumanism), this article suggests that superman fiction, often dismissed as 
    fascist and naive, had certain interesting political ramifications during the late 1930s and early 1940s.

    This article draws on research conducted for my [book project on transhumanism](#transhumanism), and
    explores the relationship between fans and pro writers during the late 1930s and early 1940s. This period,
    which I call the "superman boom," was a transitional one for both fandom and the culture of professional writers.
    As an autonomous fan culture began to articulate itself, John W. Campbell's rise as the editor of _Astounding_
    also gave shape to the idea that SF could be taken seriously as an artform. This superman boom, an almost
    endless stream of stories and novels varying the themes of a genetically superior but persecuted elite taken from
    A.E. van Vogt's hugely popular 1939 novel _Slan_, suggested a number of interesting political engagements, including
    early involvement by SF writers in Alfred Korzybski's General Semantics program and the creation of a number of
    fan-organized Utopian communities. These movements, oddly, coincide with the dawn of World War II and borrow
    heavily from the fascist rhetoric of America's enemies, culminating in fan Claude Degler labelling, in all
    seriousness, this period as the moment of "fanationalism." Inevitably, the ethical tensions this association
    with Nazism provoked proved unsustainable, but the also point toward the potent moment of emergence for what we
    now recognize as SF fan culture.
