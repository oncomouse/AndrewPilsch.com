    My current book project explores the rhetoric of the transhumanism movement with regards specifically to its Utopian content.

    This project develops the rhetorical mode of "evolutionary futurism" and the rhetoric of the transhumanist movement. While transhumanism is usually dismissed by scholars of rhetoric, technology, and culture as a fringe movement with limited scope, my project instead argues that "transhumanism" is a name for a much more pervasive rhetorical mode that considers technology as a vector for evolutionary change operating on society, consciousness, and biology. I call this rhetorical mode "evolutionary futurism," and, in tracing this formation throughout 20th and 21st century culture, I suggest that transhumanism, rather than a fringe movement of renegade scientists and philosophers, is actually a postmodern form of Utopia in line with Fredric Jameson's discussion of the concept in _Postmodernism_.

    My book then traces the rhetorical, Utopian mode I call "evolutionary futurism" through a number of important moments in the 20th and 21st centuries. 

    Chapters discuss:

    1. The relationship between **theosophy** and **evolutionary biology** in the 1920s and 30s. This connection suggests that more than just a theory of genetic evolution, transhumanism authors a theory of cognitive and spiritual evolution.
    1. The role of evolutionary futurism in the "superman" boom of **American science fiction during the 1930s and 40s**. From these tales of genetic supermen, I discuss how writers of this period, including AE van Vogt and Isaac Asimov, inspired a host of **utopian communities** dedicated to the evolution of human consciousness.
    1. The shape of the contemporary transhumanist movement, as exemplified by **Raymond Kurzweil**, technologist and author of _The Singularity is Near_. This chapter specifically considers the relationship between Kurzweil's singularitarian philosophy and Ayn Rand's objectivism. In doing so, I highlight the **selfishness problem** present in contemporary evolutionary futurism.
    1. The importance of **Pierre Teilhard de Chardin**, the paleontologist and Jesuit theologian who first coined the term "transhumanism," as a thinker of **contemporary Utopia**. In Teilhard's transhumanism, the suffering of a "cosmic Christ" becomes the model for individuals' struggle, on behalf of all mankind, with evolutionary advancement.
    1. The role of **aesthetics** in actualizing contemporary transhumanism. This chapter considers both "high" and "low" online art, in the form of **[The New Aesthetic](http://new-aesthetic.tumblr.com/)** and **[meme culture](http://memebase.com)**, as tools designed to visualize and focus an emerging cosmic consciousness.
