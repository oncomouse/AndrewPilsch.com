    My first book project (University of Minnesota Press in Fall 2017) explores the rhetoric of the transhumanism movement with regards specifically to its Utopian content.

    This project develops the rhetorical mode of "evolutionary futurism" and the rhetoric of the transhumanist movement. While transhumanism is usually dismissed by scholars of rhetoric, technology, and culture as a fringe movement with limited scope, my project instead argues that "transhumanism" is a name for a much more pervasive rhetorical mode that considers technology as a vector for evolutionary change operating on society, consciousness, and biology. I call this rhetorical mode "evolutionary futurism," and, in tracing this formation throughout 20th and 21st century culture, I suggest that transhumanism, rather than a fringe movement of renegade scientists and philosophers, is actually a postmodern form of Utopia in line with Fredric Jameson's discussion of the concept in _Postmodernism_.

    My book then traces the rhetorical, Utopian mode I call "evolutionary futurism" through a number of important moments in the 20th and 21st centuries. 

    **Chapters Summaries**

    1. The first chapter considers the origin of evolutionary futurism in continental modernism. Specifically, the chapter traces out the reception of Nietzsche's *Ã¼bermensch* as a figure for radical evolution rather than enlightened self-interest. Theosophist P.D. Ouspensky and Futurist Mina Loy are considered as guides for this particular uptake of Nietzsche.
    1. The second chapter explores evolutionary futurist rhetoric in pre-WWII American science fiction during the "superman boom," my term for the period immediately before and during the start of the war in which John W. Campbell solicited a considerable mass of stories about genetically evolved superhumans for his magazines. Concomitant to this publishing fad, SF fan culture also became intersted in actualizing this evolutionary futurist in its calls for an evolved "fannationalism."
    1. The third chapter is about the role of suffering and hedonism in an evolutionary futurism. Questioning the dominant transhuman rhetorical mode in which evolving beyond the human will be blissful, I explore the thinking of Teilhard de Chardin, the Jesuit who first coined the term "transhuman" in its modern usage, as a model for an evolutionary vanguard not tied to dubious notions of winner-take-all evolution.
    1. The fourth chapter asks after aesthetics and evolutionary futurism. In the realm of high art, I consider the impact of Natasha Vita-More's manifesto for transhuman art and the work of Arakawa and Gins, who adopt principles of evolutionary futurist rhetoric to art and architecture. I juxtapose this aesthetic with the "transhuman inaesthetic," my term for the often bland and beige futurism of transhumanists such as Raymond Kurzweil and Zoltan Istvan. Finally, I conclude by arguing that this inaesthetic blinds many transhumanists to the evolutionary futurist aspects of online "low art" movements, such as meme culture.
    1. The book concludes by discussing accelerationism and xenofeminism as recent examples of imagining an evolutionary futurist vanguard politics.
