    Presentation for SLSA 13 on Lovecraft and Air-conditioning.

    In this paper, I use H.P. Lovecraft's 1926 story about air conditioning and its abilities to unnaturally extend the life of a mad scientist as a conceptual image giving access to what I call "autophagic modernity." In Lovecraft's story, the character of Dr. Mu√±oz uses an early ammonia-based, gasoline-powered absorption refrigerator to prevent the rapid decay of his long-dead and chemically preserved body. When he runs out of ammonia in the middle of the night, his neighbor discovers all that remains of him: a puddle of ooze. In this paper, I use this plot as a microcosmic focus on our unsustainable relationship with cooling. Americans, who use more electricity on air conditioning than the continent of Africa uses for all purposes, are in an analogous position: sustained by coolant and petroleum while stocks of these chemicals are rapidly depleting. This condition of general collapse is, I argue, indicative of the essential character of our cultural moment: what I label as autophagic modernity. In this era, the technologies that make modernity possible---technologies such as fossil fuels, antibiotics, and factory farming---are beginning to break down in a way that specifically consumes modernity's users. By introducing this concept through Lovecraft, I conclude by highlighting that the majority of his fiction can, in fact, be read, like "Cool Air," as anticipating this current crisis.
